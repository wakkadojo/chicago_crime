<h2 class="section-heading exec_header">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>
<ul>
    <li> Crime in Chicago has decreased by over 30% since 2002
    <li> Crimes rates among the worst-off populations have decreased slower than average, with virtually no crime reduction in some neighborhoods; this is directly responsible for the increase in crime inequality
        <ul>
        <li> We further measured the crime inequality with two quantitative metrics which also captured this trend
        </ul>
    <li> Violent crime is a particular issue, as it has decreased the least of all major crime categories, and remains extremely concentrated in distressed areas
        <ul>
        <li> Because of the Violent crime holdout, the typical crime in Chicago has worsened in recent years
        </ul>
    <li> Crime measurements accounted for the seriousness, or severity, of crimes as opposed the most common municpal disclosures which simply report total crime count per person
</ul>
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="section-heading">Painting Crime Measurements on the Chicago Canvas</h2>

<p>
To illuminate the crime levels and crime inequality we measured, lets look at the different communities in the city in the context of the crime they experience. Strikingly, but not surprisingly, the high-, average-, and low-crime neighborhoods divide the city into three geographically and demographically segregated worlds:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Affluents:</b> A mostly white population, and the only subgroup experiencing population growth; this archetype has low crime rates, has experienced dramatic increases in earnings, and has surprisingly experienced a recent uptick in crime
        <li><b>Diverse Middle Class:</b> A mixed-race middle-class population comprising half the city and representative of the mean crime trends
        <li><b>Distressed:</b> Predominantly Black population with the highest crime rate and elevated Violent crime; The only archetype with shrinking incomes and some neighborhoods that experienced little to no crime reduction since 2002
    </ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Wealth Inequality Motivates a Look at Crime Inequality</h2>

<p><font color="red">Do I want this to be so gradeur.. or should I just focus on crime?</font></p>

<p><font color="red">Need to inline references</font></p>

<p>We begin jumping into the crime measurements by noting what initially piqued interest in a look at crime equality in Chicago: wealth equality. While the growth of the middle class provided dramatic quality of life improvements and productivity growth in the first half of the 20th century, it, and wealth equality, has been under siege in the US for decades.
</p>

<p>The concentration of wealth from the 1960's through the 1990's happened while real median incomes continued to rise, meaning the continued economic growth was shared in some part with the general population. However, from the 2000's to the present, real median incomes in the US have stagnated while the US economy has in general expanded. As of the last 20 years, virtually all of the benefits of economic growth have been channelled to the wealthiest Americans, bolstering wealth inequality.
</p>

<p>This prompted us to dive into crime and crime equality, with a lens on Chicago: a city with particularly unfortunate class gaps in wealth, education, and crime. How concentrated is crime among the distressed? How has the concentration changed over time? Have conditions been broadly improving? These are the sort of questions explored below. While not attempting to venture into the interplay between crime and income, why observed crime trends have transpired, or what the future holds, we hope that you can get a taste of the fact that crime equality, like wealth equality, too is eroding, and that some populations are being left behind.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesizing Crimes</h2>

<p>
The central dataset for this study is a nearly <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2">comprehensive dataset of reported crimes in Chicago since 2001</a>, generously provided by the CPD. Note, however, that this dataset contains over 6.5 million reported incidents as of January 2018, and these incidents come in hundreds of different varieties. There's a lot of data here, and it needs to be synthesized. That is, we need to look at aggregates of crime. This requires an apples-to-apples comparison of crimes. Typically, municipalities report their total crime in terms of crime occurrence (the number of crimes per year). This was wholly unsatisfying.
</p>

<p>
For example, there were <font color="red">XX</font> incidents of Vandalism and <font color="red">YY</font> incidents of Robbery in 2017. Which is a bigger problem? How much total crime was there? If there are 500 fewer Vandalism incidents, but 500 more Robbery incidents (Robbery being a far more serious crime), has crime stayed constant, or has it increased?
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, in order to look at crime distributions and inequality, we need to say which Chicagoans are being affected by which crimes.
This motivates a framework for synthesizing crime rates, so that we can aggregate crimes of different types, and be able to look at and compare broad groups of crimes. Note that here we are interested in the long-term behavior of crime in Chicago.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Focus on categories rather than details; look at Total city crime and the three major crime types: Property Crime, Crime against Society, and Violent Crime
    <li> Seasonally adjust the crime rates to remove distracting mean-reverting, periodic variation
    <li> All crimes not created equal: in order to compare and attribute crimes we weight crimes by how severe they are
    <li> Crimes affect a community: when crimes are happening around you, you are affected indirectly (culture, children) or directly (a victim)
</ul>

<p>
Below you can see how weighting crimes by their sentencing in fact changes how prevalent different crimes are. In particular, Property crimes are underestimated when looking at frequency alone. Crime against Society is dramatically reduced when weighting by crime severity, which is understandable as these are not Index crimes (serious crimes or crimes with malicious intent). We also show a slightly more granular view of the crimes in the three major crime categories to get a sense of their composition.

</div>

<h2 class="section-subheading">Click Down on Data Sources and Aggregation Specifics (optional)</h2>
<p>
Regarding seasonality, we looked at crimes via a one year moving average -- this is a simple way to remove both seasonal variation and random variation. Note that because our data begins in 2001, our one year moving average begins on January 2002, and represents crimes for the <i>preceding</i> year and is a lagging indicator.</p>

<p>To produce crime distributions at a point in time, we assumed that the people in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago">Chicago Community Area</a> were uniformly affected by recent crimes in their Community Area. Community areas were used because they have not been redistricted through time, unlike regions like Chicago Wards or Congressional Districts, and because Community Areas correspond to familiar neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
In order to size up a single crime as reported we used the average crime sentencing from a dataset of Cook County crime sentencing heroically gathered by the <a href="http://convictions.smartchicagoapps.org/#intro">Convicted in Cook</a> team. The convictions data for 2005 to 2009 was gathered by working with the Chicago courts over a 2 year period. Note, however, there's a difference between crime convictions according to the Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS codes) and the crime as reported via the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR codes). These are not exactly corresponding, since much of the sentencing is determined in court as details of the case (actual infringement, crime intent, etc.) are elucidated. Nevertheless, we could correspond the sentencing information (ILCS) with the reported crime (IUCR) via another <a href="https://github.com/sc3/python-iucr">heroic effort</a>. Demographics information were gathered from <a href="http://www.robparal.com/ChicagoCommunityAreaData.html">aggregations by Rob Paral</a>, where Census and American Community Survey data were summarized to Chicago Community Areas from Census Tracts.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Measuring Crime and Crime Inequality Through Time</h2>

<p>
To build on the above method of being able to compare crimes <i>relatively</i>, we need an <i>objective</i> measurement of how much crime any given person is experiencing in a given neighborhood. This measurement we call <i>Crime Intensity</i> and aims to measure how much total crime there is per person per year, and varies through time geographically throughout the city. From this, we can look at distributions among the Chicago population. In plain English, this means ... 
</p>

 <blockquote style="text-align: center; color: black;">Crime Intensity = (# years served) / person if average prison sentence served in full for every crime reported</blockquote>

<p>Before we dive into the exhibit below capturing crime levels, distributions, and inequality over time, let us develop a little bit of intuition behind these numbers. Lets consider a Total Crime Intensity of 0.15, similar to the Chicago long term average (as you will see in Exhibit 4), as an example. Assuming the fraction of the population in serving sentences is unchanged, this would correspond to 15% of the population serving sentences at any given time.
</p>

<p> That means, if every crime reported was served in full, our measurement indicates 15% of Chicago would be in prison. This is clearly a huge number as nationally in the USA this rate is 1%. This is because, in fact, most crimes are unsolved, and most sentences are not served in full. When we look at the arrest rate for a reported crime (28% in Chicago), the fraction of prison sentence served (75% nationally) and the fraction of arrests leading to conviction (75% nationally), we end up with 2% of Chicago in prison. This is far closer to the national average. Further noting that Chicago is an urban population with a large Black population, which unfortunately has a far higher prison rate than other races, this objective Crime Intensity number makes a lot of sense.
</p>

<p>
We present two ways of measuring crime inequality through time: 
    <ol>
        <li>The <b>crime ratio</b>: a simple measure of the amount of crime in high-crime neighborhoods as compared to that of low-crime neighborhoods
        <li>The crime <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a></b>, which borrows from measuring wealth inequality across a population
    </ol>
Examples of these measures is shown below to help understand how crime distributions in the city are represented by these measures.
</p>

<div class="exhibit_container">
<div class="exhibit_header"><b>Exhibit 3:</b> Toy example of inequality measures</div>
<div class="exhibit_description">
    <div>
        Play around by dragging the tops of the bars in the four neighborhoods
            <ul>
                <li>Can you make a Gini coefficient of 0?
                <li>Given these dials, how high can you get the coefficient?
                <li>Why can't you get the coefficient to be 1? 
                    <ul><li>Hint: it's not only because we limited the minimum crime intensity in the example</ul>
            </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="autotext" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em">
In the top figure we show an interactive crime distribution for example neighborhoods of equal population. These distributions apply equal crime levels to the population in a given neighborhood, the same simplification used in the actual inequality measurements.
</div>
<div class="autotext">
One way of looking at inequality is the <b>crime ratio</b>: a measurement of how much more crime there is in bad neighborhoods as compared to good ones. This is shown above the top figure.
Another way to gauge inequality is with the <b>Gini coefficient</b>, which is related to the area under the "Lorenz curve" shown in the bottom figure. 
    <ul>
        <li>The measure lies between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates more inequality
        <li>A triangular area in the bottom figure means crime is evenly distributed, and has a Gini coefficient of 0
        <li>The Gini coefficient synthesizes the inequality across the <i>entire</i> population, versus the crime ratio just considering the edges
    </ul>
</div>
<svg width="800" height="575" id="gini_example_svg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"></svg>
<script style="javascript" src="static/js/d3viz/inequality_toy_example.js"></script>
</div>

<p>

Since 2002, where our measurements begin, crime throughout the city has reduced dramatically, yet inequality still remains high and rising.

<ul>
    <li> Crime is felt highly unevenly throughout the city: the high crime quartile experiences over 5x the crime as the low-crime quartile
    <li> This inequality has increased measurably since 2002, where our measurements begin
    <li> Total crime is down by over 30%, and dramatic progress has been made against crime in general in Chicago
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Adding some color to these measurements, the increase in Total crime inequality has been driven mainly by an increase in Property crime inequality before 2008. This can clearly be seen in the measurements of the crime Gini coefficient over time. Property crime is the main driver because Violent crimes have been stubborn, where inequality has remained disturbingly high and crime levels have barely decreased. Furthermore, while inequality has soared in Crime against Society, its total crime share is roughly 10% of all crime in the city, rendering Crime against Society as largely irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
It also is worth mentioning that, while not shown here, the average severity of a crime has in fact increased over time. This is due to the fact that nonviolent crimes have dropped whereas violent crimes, which typically are higher severity than the average crime, have only mildly decreased.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Challenges, Unknowns, and Caveats</h2>

<p> There were many measurement decisions made to compile these results, producing bases to the ideal concepts of crime levels and distributions. While we do not believe any of the below is significant enough to radically alter the conclusions of the work, we present some of the implications and exploration of key measurement decisions or unknowns.
</p>

<p>Regarding the approximation that crime is felt uniformly in a neighborhood, there are multiple ways that this approximation is challenged. For example, in areas with high changes in crime, where for example bordering neighborhoods have very different crime levels. Furthermore, other demographic factors like working versus unemployed or different age groups will all effect how crime is concentrated even within a single neighborhood.
</p>

<p>We also did not have exact sentencing data, as it would have been difficult to source the resulting sentence from the Office of the Chief Judge in Cook County. As such, we resorted to associating crime with a separate dataset whose correspondence (ILCS to IUCR) with the base dataset was nontrivial. The sentencing dataset might not have been representative, or the mapping to our base dataset might have introduced errors.</p>

<p>Also, as the nature of crime, crime inequality, and changes through time were all not fundamentally understood, there is a possibility that there are confounding variables that, once appropriately taken into account, affect the normalization and alter the crime measurements. Some examples of this include shifting demographics (like an aging population), changes in crime policy or crime reporting standards, or hysterisis from external driving factors like the weather.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Next Steps</h2>

<p><font color="red">Still brainstorming what to put below</font></p>

<ul>
    <li> Drivers? Challenges? Debt? Institutions? Education? Culture?
    <li> Get a better measure of crime severity + how to source it (such as working with CPD to get real convictions info)
    <li> Additional data triangulations, such as holistic measurements of wealth, including real estate value, foreclosures + how to source it, education trends
    <li> Relationship between crime and demographics change -- which populations are growing and shrinking? Which age groups? Which income levels?
    <li> What is happening in the rest of the USA? Is it the same or different than Chicago? Can this help identify drivers?
