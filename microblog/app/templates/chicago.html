<h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h1>

<ul>
    <li> Inequality in America: wealth. GDP growing, markets peaking, but median incomes are stubborn
    <li> Inequality in America: education -- high school graduation rates, college, problem of high cost of college and impending automation wave (education crisis)
    <li> Here we look at inequality in a different lens, considering the crime inequality in Chicago, and how that inequality has been chaning over the past 15 years. 
    <li> We are able to do this by synthesizing the millions of crimes that have occurred over the past decades.
    <li> Goals of crime synthesis
        <ul>
            <li> Understand how crime inequality is changing
        </ul>
    <li> Within this framework, we look to understand how crime is now, and how things have been changing over time
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesizing Crimes</h2>

<p>
Understanding crime holistically definitively means we need to focus on themes rather than details -- that is, we need to look at aggregates of crime. This requires an apples-to-apples comparison of crimes. Typically, municipalities report their total crime in terms of crime occurrence (the number of crimes per year). This was wholly unsatisfying.
</p>

<p>
For example, there were <font color="red">XX</font> incidents of Vandalism in 2017 and <font color="red">YY</font> incidents of Robbery. Which is a bigger problem? How much total crime was there? If there are 500 fewer Vandalism incidents, but 500 more Robbery incidents (Robbery being a far more serious crime), has crime stayed constant, or has it increased?
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, in order to look at crime distributions and inequality, we need to say which Chicagoans are being affected by which crimes.
This motivates a framework for synthesizing crime rates, so that we can aggregate crimes of different types, and be able to look at and compare broad groups of crimes. Note that here we are interested in the long-term behavior of crime in Chicago.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Focus on what the pieces tell you, not the pieces themselves
        <ul>
            <li> Look at Total city crime and the three major crime categories: Property Crime, Crime against Society, and Violent Crime
            <li> Seasonally adjust the crime rates to remove distracting repeated annual variation
        </ul>
    <li> All crimes not created equal: in order to compare and attribute crimes we weight crimes by how severe they are
    <li> Crimes affect a community: when crimes are happening around you, you are affected indirectly (culture, children) or directly (a victim)
</ul>

<p>
In order to size up a single crime as reported we used the average crime sentencing from a dataset of Cook County crime sentencing heroically gathered by the <a href="http://convictions.smartchicagoapps.org/#intro">Convicted in Cook</a> team. The convictions data for 2005 to 2009 was gathered by working with the Chicago courts over a 2 year period. Note, however, there's a difference between crime convictions according to the Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS codes) and the crime as reported via the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR codes). These are not exactly corresponding, since much of the sentencing is determiined in court as details of the case (actual infringement, crime intent, etc.) are elucidated. Nevertheless, we could correspond the sentencing information (ILCS) with the reported crime (IUCR) via another <a href="https://github.com/sc3/python-iucr">heroic effort</a>.
</p>

<p>
Below you can see how weighting crimes by their sentencing in fact changes how prevalent different crimes are. In particular, Property crimes are underestimated when looking at frequency alone. Crime against Society is dramatically reduced when weighting by crime severity, which is understandable as these are not Index crimes (serious crimes or crimes with malicious intent). We also show a slightly more granular view of the crimes in the three major crime categories to get a sense of their composition.

    <script style="javascript" src="static/js/d3viz/crime_weighting_diff.js"></script>

</div>

<p>
Other decisions regarding crime synthesis were handling seasonality and crime distribution among the population. We handled seasonality by looking at crimes via a one year moving average -- this is a simple way to remove both seasonal variation and random variation. We assumed that a population in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago">Chicago Community Area</a> were equally affected by crimes in the community area. Community areas were used because they have not been redistricted through time, unlike things like Chicago Wards or Congressional Districts, and because they correspond to familiar neighborhoods.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Measuring Crime and Crime Inequality</h2>

<p>
To build on the above method of being able to compare crimes <i>relatively</i>, we need an <i>objective</i> measurement of how much crime any given person is experiencing in a given neighborhood. This measurement we call <i>Crime Intensity</i> and aims to measure how much total crime there is per person per year, and varies through time geographically throughout the city. From this, we can look at distributions among the Chicago population. In plain english, this means ... 
</p>

 <blockquote style="text-align: center; color: black;">Crime Intensity = (# years served) / person if average prison sentence served in full for every crime reported</blockquote>

<p>Before we dive into the exhibit below capturing crime levels, distributions, and inequality over time, let us develop a little bit of intuition behind these numbers. Lets look at a Total Crime Intensity of 0.15, similar to the Chicago long term average, as an example. Assuming the fraction of the population in serving sentences is unchanged, this would correspond to 15% of the population serving sentences at any given time.
</p>

<p> That means, if every crime reported was served in full, 15% of Chicago would be in prison. This is clearly a huge number as nationally in the USA this rate is 1%. This is because, in fact, most crimes are unsolved, and most sentences are not served in full. When we look at the arrest rate for a reported crime (28% in Chicago), the fraction of prison sentence served (75% nationally) and the fraction of arrests leading to conviction (75% nationally), we end up with 2% of Chicago in prison. This is far closer to the national average. Further noting that Chicago is an urban population with a large Black population, which unfortunately has a far higher prison rate than other races, this objective Crime Intensity number makes a lot of sense.
</p>

<p>
We present two ways of measuring crime inequality through time: 
    <ol>
        <li>The <b>crime ratio</b>: a simple measure of the amount of crime in high-crime neighborhoods as compared to that of low-crime neighborhoods
        <li>The crime <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a></b>, which borrows from measuring wealth inequality across a population
    </ol>
Examples of these measures is shown in Exhibit 2 to help understand how crime disrtributions in the city are represented by these measures.
</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Can you make a Gini coefficient of 0?
                <li>Given these dials, how high can you get the coefficient?
                <li>Why can't you get the coefficient to be 1? 
                    <ul><li>Hint: it's not only because we limited the minimum crime intensity in the example</ul>

<div class="autotext" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em">
In the top figure we show an interactive crime distribution for example neighborhoods of equal population. These distributions apply equal crime levels to the population in a given neighborhood, the same simplification used in the actual inequality measurements.
</div>
<div class="autotext">
One way of looking at inequality is the <b>crime ratio</b>: a measurement of how much more crime there is in bad neighborhoods as compared to good ones. This is shown above the top figure.
Another way to gauge inequality is with the <b>Gini coefficient</b>, which is related to the area under the "Lorenz curve" shown in the bottom figure. 
    <ul>
        <li>The measure lies between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates more inequality
        <li>A trianglular area in the bottom figure means crime is evenly distributed, and has a Gini coefficient of 0
        <li>The Gini coefficient synthesizes the inequality across the <i>entire</i> population, versus the crime ratio just considering the edges
