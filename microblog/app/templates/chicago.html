<h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>

<p>
While crime in Chicago has generally decreased dramatically over the last 15 years, how is the progress distributed among the population? How is it distributed among the type of crime? These questions are the motivation for the investigations outlined below, where we analyze overall crime through time in the city, the "crime inequality" itself, and how the "crime inequality" in the city as varied since the early 2000's.
<p>

<p>
We measure "Crime Intensity" in Chicago since 2002 broken into its major categories: Property Crime, Violent Crime, and Crime Against Society. We will soon elaborate more on "Crime Intensity", but for now think of it as:
</p>
 <blockquote style="text-align: center;">Crime Intensity = (# years served) / person if average prison sentence served in full for every crime reported</blockquote>

<p>
In line with the generally known reduction in crime, this analysis indeed shows a decline in crime by a marked 30% over the last 15 years (though there has also been a slight resurgence over the last few years). This is largely due to a decrease in Property Crime and Crimes against Society; Violent Crimes have remained closer to their 2002 levels. Feel free to explore the data in the figure below.
</p>

            <script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/d3viz/crime_type_summary.js"></script>

<p>
However, while crime has fallen, it has not fallen uniformly throughout the city. In fact, those feeling the worst crime are feeling a higher fraction now than they have in the past. By looking at how crime is distributed geographically throughout the city, we can get a sense of how concentrated crime is over time. 
</p>

<p>
Again, the nature of this measurement will be elaborated below, but the signal can be seen when clearly looking at how much crime is felt by the worst quartile (worst 25%) as compared to the safest quartile. Among all crimes ("Total") since 2002, crime concentration among the worst areas went from 4.5x that of the safest areas to 5.5x. This was driven by an increase in crime inequality across the board (there was no single category driver).
